          I have completed projects based on my course in full-stack web
          development. All the projects assigned to me through the full-stack
          web development course helped me learn

          in a series of practical projects that allowed me to apply these
          skills in real-world scenarios. These projects not only solidified my
          technical abilities but also honed my problem-solving skills and
          design sensibilities. My journey through this course has equipped me
          to make a meaningful impact in the world of web development.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Kavya Datchayani. I am a passionate full-stack web developer.
          I started my journey as a web developer in January 2023. It's been
          almost 9 months, and I have learned a lot of things that are essential
          for becoming a full-stack web developer. I started with HTML, CSS,
          Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and
          more. But did I master anything?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="no">N</span>o, not really. I only learned about 50% of
          everything in the course I enrolled in. It's an online course by
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/"
            >Angela Yu</a
          >, and she taught everything quite well. However, after completing
          every module, I was stuck at the end. I was puzzled and confused about
          everything I had learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a lot of thought, I realized that all I had done was follow
          instructions. If I encountered any errors, it wasn't easy to solve
          them on my own. I felt like I needed help, so I decided to take things
          slowly and started working on projects based on the languages I had
          learned. We all need patience in the end to achieve what we really
          want.
        </p>
        <p>
          And <span class="yes">Y</span>es, I started coding on my own and
          encountered many errors. It made me learn a lot, and I became pretty
          good in everything but still i sometimes feel like a mess but i know
          how to find the solution. Finding Solution, It's all we need to become
          Full-Stack Web Developer . All I'm saying here is, don't give up
          quickly. Learn, code, be consistent, repeat, and you will succeed.
        </p>
